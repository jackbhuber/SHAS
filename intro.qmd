# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Spiritual and religious abuse has been a serious problem which is gaining the attention of the psychological research community. @KochEdstrom2022 define spiritual abuse as "a type of emotional and psychological abuse perpetrated by a religious leader or group and/or with a religious or spiritual component, usually involving coercion or control." Such abuse can range from psychologically controlling behaviors like quoting scripture or invoking divine rationale for mistreatment (Oakley et al., 2018); to diverse emotionally abusive behaviors such as rejecting, isolating, terrorizing, ignoring, corrupting, verbally assaulting, and over-pressuring (Pearl, 1994); to sexual or other physical forms of abuse by a clergy member (Doyle, 2006). Spiritual abuse can also range in specificity from abusive acts by religious leaders to abuse perpetrated by a religious group or person representing a religious group with a religious or spiritual component (Swindle, 2017). Spiritual abuse may also include theologically sanctioned mistreatment of a group of people such LGBTQ+ persons (Foster, Bowland, & Vosler, 2015).

Spiritual and religious abuse has serious negative effects (Ward, 2011; Swindle, 2017; Oakley & Kinmond, 2014; Stevens et al. 2019). Religious leaders may be on a par with parents in their potential for abusive harm. Further, trauma that takes place in a religious or spiritual setting may deprive victims of religion and spirituality as a coping strategy. There are also concerns related to secondary trauma for clinicians working with R/S abused clients (Gubi & Jacobs, 2009).

In light of these concerns, a valid scale of spiritual harm and abuse is needed. Practitioners who treat clients who may be victims of religious and spiritual abuse need an instrument for clinical use. Clinicians could use such a tool as part of the intake process, to evaluate their client's score in light of established norms. In addition, researchers need a reliable measurement of spiritual abuse to examine relationships between spiritual abuse and any number of other psychological, health, or other measures.

Drawing from a recent unpublished scale of religious and abuse [@Keller2016] and other scales of abuse (Kira, et al. 2008; Sanders & Becker-Lausen, 1995; Carlson, et al. 2011; Briere & Runtz, 1989), @KochEdstrom2022 developed the Spiritual Harm & Abuse Scale (SHAS). These authors drew from the literature and interviews to find a wide range of experiences and emotional states that could be described as spiritual harm and abuse. From this work they developed a pool of 66 prompts for an online community survey which they fielded in 2021. Their study of the factor structure revealed a handful of factors which they used to distill items to a 27-item scale with six subscales.

In this paper, we build upon the work of @KochEdstrom2022 to further validate the SHAS by using item response theory. Item response theory can enhance clinical assessments in several ways. First, IRT provides interval-level measures which are more appropriate for statistical analysis than ordinal-level sum scores. Second, IRT improves upon sum scores by providing a scale along which both items and persons can be located. Third, measurements derived from IRT are sample-free, meaning it is possible to estimate a person's level of the latent construct free of the distribution of individual items and to estimate an item's difficulty level free from the distribution of people used in the sample. Finally, IRT improves upon single overall reliability coefficients by providing examination of precision across the score continuum.

The goal of this study was thus to use the Rasch Rating Scale Model (an IRT model) to enhance the SHAS in several ways. First, we aimed to express the SHAS as a single interval-level outcome measure of severity of spiritual harm and abuse. Second, we aimed to enrich the diagnostic value of the items and scale by examining severity. Third, we aimed to examine the distribution of item severities to see where the scale provides the most precise, reliable measurement of spiritual abuse. Such a scale also lays the foundation to further develop the SHAS by identifying anchor items that can calibrate with pilot items on future forms. Finally, we aimed to establish a SHAS score that is free of differential item functioning based on race, gender, and other demographic variables.
